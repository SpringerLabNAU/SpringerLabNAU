## 🧭 About

The **Springer Ecohydrology & Hydrogeology Lab** at **Northern Arizona University (NAU)** investigates the linkages between groundwater, surface water, and ecosystems in arid and semi-arid landscapes. Our research spans from the **Grand Canyon** to the **Mogollon Rim**, advancing understanding of how climate, geology, and land management affect water availability and ecosystem resilience.

### **Mission**
To improve understanding of **groundwater–surface water interactions**, **karst hydrogeology**, and **springs ecohydrology** through an integration of **field monitoring, geospatial analysis, and modeling** — supporting sustainable management of the Southwest’s most vital water resources.

### **Geographic Focus**
🗺️ The **Colorado Plateau and Grand Canyon region**, extending across northern Arizona and adjacent areas of the Southwest.

### **Core Research Themes**
- 💧 *Springs Ecohydrology*: Long-term monitoring and analysis of spring ecosystems in Grand Canyon National Park and surrounding landscapes.  
- 🌲 *Forest & Landscape Management Impacts on Recharge*: Evaluating how thinning, wildfire, and restoration affect infiltration and groundwater recharge.  
- 🧪 *Dye Tracing & Subsurface Connectivity*: Establishing a fluorescent dye tracing lab to characterize flow paths in karst aquifers and fractured volcanic terrains.  
- 🕳️ *Karst Landscape Characterization*: Mapping sinkholes, lineaments, and recharge features using high-resolution DEMs, LiDAR, and remote sensing.  
- 🌊 *Quantifying Baseflow & Groundwater Contributions*: Combining hydrologic and isotopic approaches to separate groundwater inputs to springs and streams.
