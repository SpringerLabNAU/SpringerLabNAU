## `dataRetrieval`

The `dataRetrieval` package is used to access hydrological data from various sources, including the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS). It provides functions to download stream discharge data, water quality data, and other hydrological measurements.

For more information, visit the [dataRetrieval CRAN page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataRetrieval/index.html) or the [dataRetrieval GitHub Page](https://doi-usgs.github.io/dataRetrieval/).

## `grwat`

The `grwat` package provides tools for hydrological analysis, including base-flow separation using the Lyne-Hollick filter.

### Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use the `grwat` package to perform base-flow separation using the Lyne-Hollick filter:

``` r
library(grwat)
# Assuming 'discharge_data' is a data frame with a 'date' column and a 'discharge' column
base_flow <- gr_baseflow(Q = discharge_data$discharge,
                         method = "lynehollick",
                         a = 0.95, # alpha parameter
                         padding = 100)
```

This will return a vector of base-flow estimates that you can then combine with your original data for further analysis or visualization.

## `FlowScreen`

The `FlowScreen` package is another tool that can be used for hydrological data analysis, including the Eckhardt filter. It provides various functions for processing and analyzing streamflow data.

### Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use the `FlowScreen` package to perform base-flow separation using the Eckhardt method:

``` r
library(FlowScreen)
# Assuming 'discharge_data' is a data frame with a 'date' column and a 'discharge' column
base_flow <- EckhardtBaseflow(discharge_data$discharge,
                              a = 0.98, # alpha parameter
                              BFImax = 0.8) # maximum base-flow index
```

This will return a vector of base-flow estimates that you can then combine with your original data for further analysis or visualization.
