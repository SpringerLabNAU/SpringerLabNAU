  abstract = {Simple hydraulic models for outØow of groundwater into a stream suggest that the form of the storage± discharge relationship for groundwater changes from linear, for a conÆned aquifer, to quadratic, for an unconÆned Øow. Tests of the form of stream Øow recessions in 11 streams, during periods of no recharge, show that for most catchments the storage±discharge relationship is more strongly non-linear than the quadratic form. However, for the commonly occurring case of recessions of duration up to about 10 days, the linear model remains a very good approximation, using a biased value of the groundwater turnover time. In contrast, estimates, from the stream hydrograph, of recharge during a storm event are very sensitive to the form of the storage±discharge relationship. The results of this study also show great variability in the parameters of the recession algorithm from one recession to another, attributable to spatial variability in groundwater recharge. An extension of the linear model to `leaky' catchments, where the recession reaches zero Øow, has been tested on two data sets.},

  abstract = {Digital filters are useful tools for assessing the contribution of groundwater to total river flow. Several of those filters have been proposed in the last decades. One of the last contributions on this subject was given by Ekchardt (2005) who proposed a more general form of a digital baseflow filter and showed that some of the most used filters are special cases of this general form. This new filter has the inconvenience of having two parameters, one of them may be obtained directly from recession analysis, but the other (maximum baseflow index (BFImax)) is routinely estimated by a priori defined values according to the predominant geological characteristics of the drainage basin. In this short communication, we propose a method to estimate BFImax by a backwards filtering operation. The method was applied using data from 15 gauging stations in Brazil, with a varied range of groundwater contribution to streamflow. Results of the new estimation method for the BFImax parameter are coherent with the values which would be adopted by considering geological characteristics of the river basins.

  abstract = {Recursive digital filtering of hydrographs is a baseflow separation method that can easily be automated and has been recommended for providing reproducible results. In the past, different formulations of the most simple filter type, the so-called one-parameter filter, have been proposed. In this paper, a theoretical framework is developed for filter algorithms that were constructed under the assumption that the outflow from an aquifer is linearly proportional to its storage. It is shown that these one-parameter filters describing an exponential baseflow recession are all special cases of a two-parameter filter whose equation is specified. Its parameters are the recession constant—which can be objectively determined by a recession analysis—and BFImax, the maximum value of the baseflow index that can be modelled by the algorithm. This introduces a subjective element into the baseflow calculation, since BFImax is not measurable. A preliminary analysis based on the results of conventional separation techniques shows that it might be possible to find typical BFImax values for classes of catchments that can be unequivocally distinguished by their hydrological and hydrogeological characteristics.

  abstract = {Recursive digital filtering of hydrographs is a widely used method to identify streamflow components, which react to precipitation with varying degrees of attenuation and delay. In this context, a distinction is often made between physically based and non-physically based algorithms. A well-known example of a physically based algorithm is that of Furey and Gupta (2001). In this paper, it is contrasted with the widely used algorithm of Eckhardt (2005). This algorithm is often considered merely a non-physically based low-pass filter. However, the comparison shows that both algorithms largely agree. The algorithm of Eckhardt (2005) differs from the algorithm of Furey and Gupta (2001) only in the time delay assumed between precipitation and the exfiltration of baseflow into surface waters and in the fact that two parameters are combined into one, BFImax. This parameter can thus be interpreted physically, and an approach for its calculation emerges.},

  abstract = {Baseflow is often considered to be the groundwater discharge component of streamflow. It is commonly estimated using conceptual models, recursive filters or a combination of the two. However, it is difficult to validate these methods due to the current challenges of measuring baseflow in the field. In this study, simulation of a synthetic catchment’s response to rainfall is carried out using a fully integrated surface water-groundwater flow model. A series of rainfall events with differing recovery periods and varied antecedent moisture conditions is considered to span a range of different streamflow generation dynamics. Baseflow is estimated for the outlet hydrograph of the synthetic catchment using a selection of commonly used automated baseflow separation methods. These estimates are compared to the baseflow signal obtained from the numerical model, which serves as the control experiment. Results from these comparisons show that depending on the method used, automated baseflow separation underestimates the simulated baseflow by as much as 28\%, or overestimates it by up to 74\%, during rainfall events. No separation method is found to be clearly superior to the others, as the performance of the various methods varies with different soil types, antecedent moisture conditions and rainfall events. The differences between the various approaches clearly demonstrate that the baseflow separation methods investigated are not universally applicable.},

  abstract = {Baseflow is the slowly varying portion of streamflow, and it is essential for sustaining river flows. Several methods have been developed for separating baseflow from streamflow. However, due to the lack of measured baseflow, past studies generally compared these baseflow separation methods qualitatively based on their hydrologic plausibility. To quantitively determine which baseflow separation method has the best accuracy, this study established a reliable evaluation criterion that relies only on measured streamflow. By applying the evaluation criterion to 1815 catchments across the contiguous United States, 9 baseflow separation methods including 4 graphic methods and 5 digital filter methods were evaluated. The evaluation result shows that the digital filter method proposed by Eckhardt (2005) has the best performance, and its performance is independent of catchment characteristics. Thus, Eckhardt digital filter method is recommended for baseflow separation across the contiguous United States.},
